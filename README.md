# Search-based task and motion planning for hybrid systems: Agile autonomous vehicles

This is accompanying code to the "Search-based task and motion planning for hybrid systems: Agile autonomous vehicles".

# Usage

The complete code for SBOMP is developed from scratch in Matlab without any additional solver of library needed.

To run the code you just need to run `main_v1_0.m` from Matlab Editor.

To enable/disable visualisations, comment/uncomment appropriate lines in the section `Simulation options` in `line 15-49` of the `main_v1_0.m`.
